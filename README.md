## Infosys Australian Open & Roland Garros 'scraped' data: [Hawkeye scrap reference](https://github.com/ryurko/hawkeye)

  - `Dictionary`: [Courtvision data_dictionary](#CourtVision-Data)
  - AO Open match example: [Sinner vs medvedev AO Open Final match page](https://ausopen.com/match/2024-jannik-sinner-vs-daniil-medvedev-ms701#!infosys-3)

AO Open and RG oficial data (and possibily other Infosys managed tournaments), is available in their website
This data is generally high quality since it provides a interface for samples of ['Hawkeye' Data](#CourtVision-Data)
However, this data had to be 'scraped' since their API is encrypted.
So this data is `public` but initially unaccessible.

Since all the matches general info (Ex. Match id, Players id, Points id) is already available: By decrypting their API responses, meaning getting a proper JSON), its possible to iterate through the matches using match info to get point by point data for each match.

These [Jeffsackmann tennis_slam_pointbypoint](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_slam_pointbypoint) datasets are incomplete mostly because they lack this kind of 'unaccessible' data

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the past, individuals successfully leveraged this API to create datasets: [Hawkeye scrap](https://github.com/ryurko/hawkeye) by dumping the JSON responses and converting them to a proper csv, however since the changes made to the Infosys API, the JSON dumping step of these scraping methods no longer work, nonetheless, now its possible to reverse engineer how their frontend processes the new encrypted API response by using the decode function from [API_Decryption Example](https://github.com/hawkilol/TennisCC/blob/main/AO_scrap_API.py) to translate it to proper JSON: [AO Open Match JSON dump](https://github.com/hawkilol/TennisCC/blob/main/atp_AO_Open_year_2024_MS101_tracking_data.json) , thus enabling their script to create fresh datasets once again ðŸ˜Ž : [Play By Play Example csv](https://github.com/hawkilol/TennisCC/blob/main/atp_australian_open_2024_MS101_pbp.csv) and [Ball Tracking example csv](https://github.com/hawkilol/TennisCC/blob/main/atp_australian_open_2024_MS101_ball_trajectory.csv) for more info see [Play By Play Description](#Play-by-Play) and [Ball Tracking Description](#Ball-Tracking-(rally)) respectively


- ! After the initial decryption, the values are intact but the property names are weird, but consistent, so by using the diff between it and a original JSON
  it can be mapped to the correct names
  

### CourtVision Data

CourtVision data, contains data that can only be obtained by high quality on court sensor like the Hawkeye system such as ball coordinates and speed... 
see the [Sinner vs medvedev AO Open Final match page](https://ausopen.com/match/2024-jannik-sinner-vs-daniil-medvedev-ms701#!infosys-3) and select CourtVision for visual reference
